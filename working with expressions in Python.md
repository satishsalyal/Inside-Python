# Working with expressions in Python

Expressions are a fundamental aspect of programming in Python, as they enable developers to perform operations on data. In Python, an expression is a combination of
values, variables, operators, and function calls that produce a result. Understanding how to work with expressions is crucial for writing effective Python code.

One important aspect of working with expressions is understanding the different types of operators available in Python. Python supports a wide range of operators,
including arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation; comparison operators such as less than, greater than, 
equal to, and not equal to; logical operators such as and, or, and not; and bitwise operators such as and, or, xor, and complement. Each operator performs a specific
operation on the data it is applied to, and it is important to understand the syntax and behavior of each operator in order to use them effectively in expressions.

Here are some examples of Python expressions that use different types of operators:

```python

# Arithmetic operators
x = 5 + 2    # Addition operator
y = 7 - 3    # Subtraction operator
z = 3 * 4    # Multiplication operator
a = 10 / 5   # Division operator
b = 2 ** 3   # Exponentiation operator

# Comparison operators
if x == y:           # Equal to operator
    print("x and y are equal")
elif x != y:         # Not equal to operator
    print("x and y are not equal")
elif x < y:          # Less than operator
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:          # Greater than operator
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x <= y:         # Less than or equal to operator
    print("x is less than or equal to y")
elif x >= y:         # Greater than or equal to operator
    print("x is greater than or equal to y")

# Logical operators
if x > y and z > a:  # And operator
    print("x is greater than y and z is greater than a")
elif x > y or z < a: # Or operator
    print("either x is greater than y or z is less than a")
elif not x > y:      # Not operator
    print("x is not greater than y")

# Bitwise operators
c = 0b1010 & 0b1100   # Bitwise and operator
d = 0b1010 | 0b1100   # Bitwise or operator
e = 0b1010 ^ 0b1100   # Bitwise xor operator
f = ~0b1010           # Bitwise complement operator
g = 0b1010 << 2       # Bitwise left shift operator
h = 0b1010 >> 2       # Bitwise right shift operator
```

Another important aspect of working with expressions is understanding how Python evaluates expressions. Python follows the standard order of operations, which means that it evaluates expressions in a specific order. First, it evaluates any expressions inside parentheses. Then, it evaluates any exponentiation operations. Next, it evaluates any multiplication, division, and remainder operations from left to right. Finally, it evaluates any addition and subtraction operations from left to right. It is important to understand how Python evaluates expressions in order to avoid errors and ensure that expressions are evaluated correctly.

Let's consider an example:

```python
x = 5 * (3 + 2) / 2
```
In this expression, Python evaluates the expression inside the parentheses first, resulting in 5. Then, it evaluates the multiplication operation, resulting in 25. 
Finally, it evaluates the division

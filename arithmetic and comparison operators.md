##  Arithmetic and Comparison Operators in Python

### Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values in Python. Here are the arithmetic operators in Python:

#### Addition (+):
The addition operator + adds two operands together. For example:
```python
x = 2
y = 3
result = x + y
print(result) # Output: 5
```
We can also use the + operator for concatenating two strings. For example:

```python

string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
result = string1 + " " + string2
print(result) # Output: "Hello World"
```
#### Subtraction (-):
The subtraction operator - subtracts the second operand from the first operand. For example:

```python

x = 5
y = 2
result = x - y
print(result) # Output: 3
```

#### Multiplication ("* "):
The multiplication operator * multiplies two operands. For example:

```python

x = 3
y = 2
result = x * y
print(result) # Output: 6
```
#### Division (/):
The division operator / divides the first operand by the second operand. For example:

```python

x = 6
y = 3
result = x / y
print(result) # Output: 2.0
If we divide two integers, the result will be a float value in Python.
```

#### Modulus (%):
The modulus operator % returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second operand. For example:

```python
Copy code
x = 7
y = 3
result = x % y
print(result) # Output: 1
```

#### Floor Division (//):
The floor division operator // returns the quotient of the division of the first operand by the second operand, rounding down to the nearest integer. For example:

```python
x = 7
y = 3
result = x // y
print(result) # Output: 2
```
Exponentiation ('** '):
The exponentiation operator ** raises the first operand to the power of the second operand. For example:
python
Copy code
x = 2
y = 3
result = x ** y
print(result) # Output: 8
```
### Comparison Operators:
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and produce a Boolean result. Here are the comparison operators in Python:

#### Equal to (==):
The equal to operator == checks if the values of two operands are equal. For example:
```python

x = 2
y = 2
result = x == y
print(result) # Output: True
```
#### Not equal to (!=):
The not equal to operator != checks if the values of two operands are not equal. For example:
```python

x = 2
y = 3
result = x != y
print(result) # Output: True
```
### #Greater than (>):
The greater than operator > checks if the value of the first operand is greater than the value of the second operand. For example:

```python

x = 3
y = 2
result = x > y
print(result) # Output: True
```
#### Less than (<):
The less than operator < checks if the value of the first operand is less than the value of the second operand. For example:

```python

x = 2
y = 3
result = x < y
print(result) # Output: True

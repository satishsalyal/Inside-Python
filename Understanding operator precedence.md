# Understanding operator precedence

In Python, operator precedence refers to the order in which different operators are evaluated within an expression. It is essential to understand how operator precedence works in Python because it can impact the final result of an expression. If operators with higher precedence are evaluated before operators with lower precedence, it can lead to unexpected results.

**For example**, let's consider the following expression:

```python
x = 2 + 3 * 4
```
Without understanding operator precedence, one might assume that Python would evaluate this expression from left to right, resulting in *20*. However, Python
follows the standard order of operations, which means that it first evaluates multiplication before addition. In this case, the multiplication operator has 
higher precedence than the addition operator, so the expression is evaluated as follows:

```python
x = 2 + (3 * 4)
```
which simplifies to:

```python
x = 2 + 12
```
and finally:

```python
x = 14
```

This example demonstrates the importance of understanding operator precedence in Python. If one did not understand operator precedence, they might make incorrect assumptions about how expressions are evaluated, leading to bugs or errors in their code.

To ensure that expressions are evaluated correctly, it is important to follow the standard order of operations and use parentheses when necessary to override the default order. For example, consider the following expression:

```pyhton
y = (2 + 3) * 4
```
Here, the parentheses force Python to evaluate the addition operation before the multiplication operation, resulting in a value of *20*.

In conclusion, understanding operator precedence in Python is crucial for writing correct and efficient code. By following the standard order of operations and using parentheses when necessary, developers can ensure that their expressions are evaluated correctly and their code works as intended.
